# [abandoned] Dizornator
### EARLY BUILD - Version 0.1.0

Dizornator is my own coded (with a lots of help) bot for my discord server. I want to learn how to code with projects like this one. You can invite him but I am not responsable for spam or malfunction.

  - Level-up system (WIP)
  - Custom Commands
  - Easter Eggs (WIP)

## Work in Progress!

  - Level-up system
  - Plays.TV feed post in text channel from selected Plays.tv users
  - Music Player

## Installation  
#### Prerequisite
 - In an **admin** command prompt or powershell, run `npm i -g --production windows-build-tools`.
 -  Close all open command prompts for your bot, or the following won't work.
 - `npm i discord.js better-sqlite3`


#### Create a new file in project root
config.json

```sh
{
  "token"  : "YOUR TOKEN KEY HERE",
  "prefix" : "+"
}
```
